## Title
After contract construction, anyone can get whitelisted

## Proof of Concept
When _isSelfWhitelistDisabled is false anyone can get self whitelisted by sending eth to the contract. The contract owner should set up _isSelfWhitelistDisabled after construction, this window between construction and initialization of _isSelfWhitelistDisabled will allow anyone to whitelist as many addresses as wanted (through a contract in few txs).

The blacklist mechanism mitigates this issue by allowing the owner to blacklist these addresses. This only makes the owner spend extra gas since the blacklist function doesn't work with addresses batches. Since this will be deployed on Ethereum it can cost the deployed a significant amount if there are many addresses incorrectly whitelisted.

## Recommended Steps
This can be easily prevented by setting _isSelfWhitelistDisabled on construction.
