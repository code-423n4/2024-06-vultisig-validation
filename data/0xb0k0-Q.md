# TickMath might revert in solidity versions > 0.8

## Description

UniswapV3â€™s TickMath library was changed to allow compilations for solidity version 0.8. However, adjustments to account for the implicit overflow behavior that the contract relies upon were not performed. The [UniswapV3Oracle.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-vultisig/blob/main/hardhat-vultisig/contracts/oracles/uniswap/UniswapV3Oracle.sol) is compiled with version `> 0.8` and indirectly uses this library through the [OracleLibrary](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-06-vultisig/blob/cb72b1e9053c02a58d874ff376359a83dc3f0742/hardhat-vultisig/contracts/oracles/uniswap/UniswapV3Oracle.sol#L5). In the worst case, it could be that the library always reverts (instead of overflowing as in previous versions), leading to broken protocol functionalities.

## Impact

The protocol might falsely revert in situations where overflowing/underflowing is required (due to the nature of Uniswap's math), leading to incorrect behavior.

## Tools used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Either use SOLC < 0.8 in the UniswapV3Oracle contract or add `unchecked`, to the `peek()` function.
